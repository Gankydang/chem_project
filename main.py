It seems like they are using toxic Elumium metal as a cheap
substitute for copper to make wires. Moreover, in the fleeting moments that you regained consciousness
while they were dragging you to your cell, you caught glimpses of weapons with the distinct pink
metal incorporated into it.

What will happen if they continue doing this?
Am I stuck here for the rest of my life?
Will my family know that I am still here?

The sound of crackling paper rouses you out of your melancholic reverie. You get up and head towards the sound.
You feel the ground in pitch dark until your fingers touch a piece of paper. It seems that someone has slipped it
into your cell. You quickly grab it and use the moonlight to read untidy words scrawled there.
It reads, "I am undercover in this facility and I am here to help you escape. Meet me at the exit,
you will have to make your way there by yourself..."
